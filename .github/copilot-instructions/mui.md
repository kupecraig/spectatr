# UI Development Instructions

-   Use Material UI (MUI) components for all UI elements and interactions.
-   Prefer MUI for complex components (e.g., dialogs, drawers, menus).
-   Avoid using other component libraries or custom CSS unless absolutely necessary.
-   Keep styling consistent with MUI's theming system.

> These guidelines apply to all new and updated code in this workspace.
